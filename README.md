# Randomize
A fun application allowing users to find random facts based on category or receive a completely randomized facts as notifications.

This web app is currently under construction, and is in a *very* alpha state. You probably shouldn't use it right now, but if you *really* want to, you can scoop up the .html file on your local machine and open it up with your browser. 

Please note that no buttons currently work and the layout doesn't look good at all. The frontend is being worked on, and the backend will be built afterwards, forming the complete application.
