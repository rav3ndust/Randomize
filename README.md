# Randomize by rav3ndust
A fun, free and fully open-source application allowing users to find random facts based on category or receive a completely randomized facts as notifications. Users are also welcome to contribute their own random facts back to the app to build an extensive list of facts (and even add more categories) if they'd like. We aim to make this project a fun and expansive list of random facts from various topics contributed by knowledgeable people from all over the world.

This app is currently under construction, and is in a *very* alpha state. You probably shouldn't use it right now, but if you *really* want to, you can scoop up the .html and .js files on your local machine (or simply *git clone* this repository) and open it up with your browser. 

Please note that only a few functions currently work and the layout is still very much WIP. This is still an active work in progress, so keep this in mind should you choose to evaluate it.

We would love contributions to this project! If you would like to help improve the design or begin adding in some "random facts" to categories in each of their respective pages (or even adding in more categories if you'd like), feel free! If you contribute, be sure to submit a PR adding your name to the "CONTRIBUTORS.md" list.
