# Randomize by rav3ndust
A fun, free and fully open-source web application allowing users to find random facts based on category or receive a completely randomized facts as notifications.

This web app is currently under construction, and is in a *very* alpha state. You probably shouldn't use it right now, but if you *really* want to, you can scoop up the .html file on your local machine and open it up with your browser. 

Please note that no buttons currently work and the layout doesn't look that great at all. This is still an active work in progress, so keep this in mind should you choose to evaluate it.

We would love contributions to this project! If you would like to help improve the design or begin adding in some "random facts" to categories in each of their respective pages, feel free! If you contribute, be sure to submit a PR adding your name to the "CONTRIBUTORS.md" list.
